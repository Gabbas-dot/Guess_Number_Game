# Guess Number Game (Python)

A console-based number guessing game built in **Python**, where the computer randomly selects a number and the player tries to guess it.

---

## Overview
The game asks the player to choose a maximum number (range). The computer picks a random number within that range.  
The player keeps guessing until they find the correct number, receiving feedback for each guess:

- **Too low** if the guess is smaller than the number  
- **Too high** if the guess is larger than the number  

The game handles invalid input and ensures only integer guesses are accepted.

## Features
- Random number generation within a user-defined range  
- Input validation for integers only  
- Feedback for every guess: "too low" / "too high"  
- Counts attempts and shows number of tries when guessed correctly  
- Option to play again or return to main menu
